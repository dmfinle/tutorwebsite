# tutoring
Tutoring website using Wyzant as inspiration
This tutoring website will use React, ExpressJs, and mongodb as its frameworks
Also will have compiling and execution capabilities geared towards programming classes.

NOTES
To run both backend and front end from root, npm run dev. Starts both concurrently.

The front end proxies requests to backend in package.json
